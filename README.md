# Sales Sales Sales

We are building this project as a third party application to be able to quickly and conveniently look up the best prices for your specific groceries in your area. This project started as a goal to help friends and family be able to save money and also not have to travel so far at times when we don't need to! We hope that we can bring this aspiring goal to fruition!
